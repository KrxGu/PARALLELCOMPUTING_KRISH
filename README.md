# Advanced Topics in High-Performance Computing

This repository contains a curated collection of my in-depth study materials on High-Performance Computing (HPC). The focus is on the foundational pillars that enable modern parallel computing, from the underlying hardware architecture to the programming paradigms used to harness its power.

### ðŸ“š Core Topics

My expertise covers the critical areas of high-performance computing, with a focus on the synergy between them. The materials here are based on foundational textbooks and my own study.

*   **Computer Architecture:** A deep understanding of the fundamental principles of computer organization is the bedrock of high-performance computing. These notes delve into the intricacies of processor design, memory hierarchies, and the hardware-software interface that dictate the performance of parallel systems.

*   **Parallel Computing Paradigms:** Mastery of parallel programming models is essential for unlocking the performance of modern multi-core and distributed systems. My materials provide a comprehensive overview of the dominant paradigms:
    *   **OpenMP:** For shared-memory systems, exploring thread-based parallelism to efficiently utilize multi-core processors.
    *   **MPI (Message Passing Interface):** The standard for distributed-memory systems, enabling communication and coordination between processes on different nodes.

### The Interrelation of Topics

These topics are not studied in isolation; they are deeply interconnected. A thorough understanding of **computer architecture** is essential for writing efficient **OpenMP** and **MPI** code. Similarly, a grasp of **parallel computing paradigms** is a prerequisite for leveraging the power of **GPUs with CUDA**. This holistic approach is the key to designing and implementing truly high-performance solutions.

### ðŸŽ“ Recommended Learning Resource

A significant portion of my learning has been guided by the excellent lecture series from IIT Delhi. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a deep and practical understanding of HPC.

*   **YouTube Playlist:** [High Performance Computing by Prof. Yogish Sabharwal, IIT Delhi](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA4ikJvIwfCFIsDDqdJzYozvdW0ffs_Df&si=f6MI_kf6IbFJmBH8)

### ðŸš€ Future Plans

This repository is a work in progress. My next steps are to:

*   **Add Code Implementations:** I will be adding practical code examples for CUDA, OpenMP, and MPI to complement these theoretical notes.
*   **Develop Mini-Projects:** To solidify my understanding, I plan to create and upload small projects that demonstrate various parallel computing techniques.
